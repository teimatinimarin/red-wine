This is a personal repo where I pretended to put in practice many concepts, frameworks and technologies that I've been interested to play with for a long time.

Some of those are:
* Java 10 new characteristics. Including Java 9 modules.
* Websocket clients in JAVA
* Docker
* Amazon fun staff, like ECS, Cloudformation, DynamoDB, SNS, etc
* Sonar Online service
* Build a CICD pipeline in the cloud
